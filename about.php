                        <h2>2017</h2>
                        <p>In 2017 we started off as creative software where our target was to build software and treat
                            it as a experience.</p>
                        <p>Our idea went extremely well as our software began to grow bigger and bigger.</p>


                        <h2>2018</h2>
                        <p>2018 was our year to show what we had made so we first made the first itiration of a online
                            art sharing tool called furryfan.
                            Furryfan was our way to show the furry community that we made and it grow from artists and
                            we countinue to update it to this day.</p>
                        <p>2018 was also a year to begin developing more software and create a new experience called
                            Modrick for the desktop space.
                            Modrick was a open os based of the Modrick kernel Modrick was named as a way of saying
                            modifier ricker meaning the OS handled tasks if they were present to the user.
                        </p>


                        <h2>2019</h2>
                        <p>2019 was a year to update furryfans codebase so at that time we updated it to be more
                            efficent for users and update it acording to users feedback.
                            2019 was also a year fo restructuring for a more modern experience to users and we started
                            our own record label BlueFox records which is a record label built for indie artists and
                            bands of any genre.</p>
                        <p>We also renamed modrick at this time to forest of as each process is like a tree with roots
                            and branch processes.</p>


                        <h2>2020</h2>
                        <p>2020 was a difficult year for everyone with issues with covid and other financial issues
                            across the globe. We managed to survive and create some new targets as more poeple were
                            moving online to places like discord and zoom we created a tool for everyone called enclica
                            messenger.
                            Enclica messenger is a open source messaging client for the Enclica expereince.</p>

                        <h2>2021</h2>
                        <p>2021 is the beginning of the new enclica software name. We also have been working more on
                            programs like Canvs and Enclica messenger.</p>
